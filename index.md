# ABSTRACT
Pendulum Thrust Stand is a device to measure the thrust of a satellite micropropulsion system in the scale of micro-Newton. The output thrust can be modeled by a second order equation of the oscillation amplitude vs time.

The device is powered by an ARM Cortex-M4F STM32 NUCLEO based driver board. The oscillation is measured using a magnetic encoder attached to the shaft of the pivot point. Data is transmitted wirelessly to the main computer and plotted in real time.
