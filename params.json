The output thrust can be modeled by a second order equation of the oscillation amplitude vs time.  \r\n\r\n![Pendulum Thrust Stand](https://googledrive.com/host/0B3qXE5D5r-qCYzhBUF81cFN6Wlk/IMG_20151101_185958_HDR.jpg)  \r\n\r\nThe device is powered by an ARM Cortex-M4F STM32 NUCLEO based driver board. The oscillation is measured using a magnetic encoder attached to the shaft of the pivot point. Data is transmitted wirelessly to the main computer and plotted in real time.\r\n\r\n![Thrust Stand Driver Board](https://googledrive.com/host/0B3qXE5D5r-qCYzhBUF81cFN6Wlk/IMG_20151031_234048_HDR.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis project is part of EG3301 [Design Centric Programme](www.eng.nus.edu.sg/edic/about.html) (Satellite System Design Track) module at the National University of Singapore.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
