The output thrust can be modeled by a second order equation of the oscillation amplitude vs time.  \r\n\r\n![Pendulum Thrust Stand](blob:https%3A//drive.google.com/228e4c5c-9e98-45de-a6e3-b5a2675fbcee)  \r\n\r\nThe device is powered by an ARM Cortex-M4F STM32 NUCLEO based driver board. The oscillation is measured using a magnetic encoder attached to the shaft of the pivot point. Data is transmitted wirelessly to the main computer and plotted in real time.\r\n\r\n![Thrust Stand Driver Board](blob:https%3A//drive.google.com/30ba45f2-a0ae-4d9e-8515-be1a5d3019e8)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
